# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project will be analysing the outcomes based on launch date and campaign goals. Through data analysis, we will be able to draw conclusions about which campaigns perform best and how we may adjust campaign strategy to ensure a higher percentage of success.

### Purpose
Through analysis, we will determine strategies on how to better set goals and launch dates to ensure the greatest successful outcomes for crowd sourced campaigns

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Reviewing the chart, we see a few obvious trends. These can be used to help determine the best and worst times to launch a campaign. Below are a few conclusions:

1. Launching campaigns near the beginning or end of the year are very likely to fail.
2. Campaigns launched between April and July have an average success rate of ~65%. This is a ~5% increase over the ~60% average during the other months of the year.
3. May and June are the best months to launch a caimpaign and are the mostly likely to each their goal.

### Analysis of Play Outcomes Based on Goals

This chart of goals tells a different story. Here we have A range of goals and the percentages of campaigns that were successful, failed or canceled. The data does reveal a pattern as outlined below:

1. Campaigns in the lower goal ranges less than $1,000 and less than $5,000 are the most successful campaigns. There are a few reasons this may be:
    - The cost to meet the goal is quite small so it requires less money to reach a successful outcome
    - There are a significantly larger number of campaigns in this goal range. The data may be averaging out to a norm given the larger set of points. However, this is not obvious in the graph
2. From the graph, it is hard to tell the number of campaigns run between the $20,000 and greater than $50,000 goal ranges. This makes it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions. The sample set may be small so the goal amount may not be an accurate contributing factor to campaign failures.
3. Even with limited data, we can infer that the larger the campaign goal the more likely it is to fail as evident by the graph.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The biggest challenge in interpreting the data is the limited information from the charts. Ideally, there would be an accompanying table to detail how many points of data we are analysing. With the additional information we could draw more concrete conclusions.

Additional tables that detail the number of campaigns analyzed and the time range would help shed light on potential causes for failure. For instance, knowing the exact number of campaigns run in the higher goal ranges for Play Outcomes Based on Goals may give a better idea of success and failure rates.

Adding a trendline to the Play Outcomes Based on Goals chart would make it easier to see the impact of higher goal amounts on the failure rate.

While line graphs are good for analyzing data over time, a stacked bar chart might be a better way to visually see the ratio of successful and failed campaigns in the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch.
